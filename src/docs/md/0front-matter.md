# Preface

This book is a collection of articles selected from SitePoint's [Performance Hub](hhttps://www.sitepoint.com/tag/performance-hub/) that will you transform your site/app into a lean, mean content delivery machine.

## Who Should Read This Book

This book is for all developers – front end and back. You’ll need to be familiar with HTML and CSS and have a reasonable level of understanding of JavaScript in order to follow the discussion.

## Conventions Used

You’ll notice that we’ve used certain typographic and layout styles throughout this book to signify different types of information. Look out for the following items.

### Code Samples

Code in this book is displayed using a fixed-width font, like so:

```html
<h1>A Perfect Summer's Day</h1>
<p>It was a lovely day for a walk in the park.
The birds were singing and the kids were all back at school.</p>
```
Where existing code is required for context, rather than repeat all of it, ⋮ will be displayed:

```js
function animate() {
    ⋮
new_variable = "Hello";
}
```

Some lines of code should be entered on one line, but we’ve had to wrap them because of page constraints. An ➥ indicates a line break that exists for formatting purposes only, and should be ignored:

```shell
URL.open("http://www.sitepoint.com/responsive-web-
➥design-real-user-testing/?responsive1");
```
